# here i will show the difference between the list and the tuple

list = [1,2,3,4,5] # it is the list. we can modify it

tup = (1,2,3,4,5) # this is tuple we cannot make changes to it

# one of the feature of the tuple is that we can insert tuple within a tuple
tup2 =(1,2,(3,4),5)

# also we can define tuple like this:

tup3 = 1, 2, 3

#let me see if i can access the elements of the tuple

print(tup[0])
print(tup2[2][0])
